# FeatureNet
We developed a novel framework using Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNNs) termed FeatureNet to learn machining features from CAD models of mechanical parts. FeatureNet learns the distribution of complex machining feature shapes across a large 3D model data set and discovers distinguishing features that help in recognition process automatically. To train FeatureNet, a large-scale mechanical part datasets of 3D CAD models with labeled machining features is synthetically constructed.
